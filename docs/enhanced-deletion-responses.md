## ðŸ›  Implementation Details

### **New Response Traits Methods**

#### `softDeletedResponse()`
- **HTTP Status**: 202 Accepted
- **Purpose**: Indicates successful soft deletion with recovery options
- **Metadata**: Includes restore endpoint and recovery instructions

#### `restoredResponse()`  
- **HTTP Status**: 200 OK
- **Purpose**: Confirms successful task restoration
- **Metadata**: Shows restored status and available next actions

#### `forceDeletedResponse()`
- **HTTP Status**: 204 No Content  
- **Purpose**: Confirms permanent deletion with warnings
- **Metadata**: Emphasizes irreversibility and provides alternatives

#### `trashedTasksResponse()`
- **HTTP Status**: 200 OK
- **Purpose**: Lists soft-deleted tasks with bulk operation options
- **Metadata**: Includes count and bulk operation endpoints

### **HTTP Status Code Strategy**

| Operation | Status Code | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Soft Delete** | `202 Accepted` | Request accepted but action is reversible |
| **Restore** | `200 OK` | Successful operation returning resource |
| **Force Delete** | `204 No Content` | Resource permanently removed |
| **List Trashed** | `200 OK` | Successful data retrieval |
